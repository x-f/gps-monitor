GPS monitor

A simple attempt to detect effects of CME impacts on Earth's ionosphere by monitoring GPS signals â€“ for starters, just the wandering around of the reported position. Later GPS satellite signal monitoring might be added.

Launch with `./start-monitor.sh`
Add to crontab: `0 */6 * * * /home/x-f/sw/gps-monitor/start-monitor.sh`

`/run/shm` is a RAMdisk, it needs to be created by user. Alternatively, logging can be done on the regular filesystem. RAMdisk was chosen to reduce the wear of the SD card.
Tested on a MK808 "minipc" (A9 dual core ARM CPU), but should run equally well on RaspberryPi. CPU usage is less than 3% with 1 Hz updates, 10-15% with 5 Hz, but there's really no gain in that many position reports.

Requirements:
  * py-serial
  * Gnuplot
  * GPS (setup commands are for Ublox GPS modules, but can be adapted for SiRF or others, there's nothing that important anyway)

TODO:
  * write a service and log file rotator, to have the monitor running constantly and restart on failures
  * detect serial port change, if by any reason it has happened
  * web page
